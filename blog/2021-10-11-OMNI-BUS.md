Glossary:

PNT - Precision Naviagtion and Timing: Technologies and equipment Designed to provide precise time solutions (like Atomic Backed Time) using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) like: GPS, Beidou, Galileo, Glonass, and b8ZS to supplement and synchronize time Worldwide.  Time is provided to downstream devices via Network Time Protocol or Precision Time Protocol.

Edge Computing: Clusters of Miniaturized Computing Hardware with combined Storage and networking to provide application services nearest to the User. i.e. The Airplane, BriefcaHardware Deployed with the User to their Location. 

Private Cloud:
