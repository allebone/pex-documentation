R^3 - Reduce Reuse Recoup Program

Description: The Project BOCKSCAR Mobile Device Program at Offutt AFB, NE has formulated a multiple option recycle plan for outdated, broken and unserviceable mobile devices. Three options currently exist that are under consideration in an effort to maximize cost savings to the Air Force, environmental disposal considerations, and a public outreach option to further strengthen local community relations. While all three options are viable solutions, final determination to the disposition of Air Force procured hardware will ultimately lie with the mobile device engineers at Offutt AFB.

With the 55th Operations Group at Offutt AFB entering into their tech-refresh period the need for a plan on how or what to do with 12-1500 out dated mobile devices now exists. It is currently estimated that greater than 95% of the devices to be returned will still be useable in some capacity. While the devices are beyond the authorized service life, as governed by 17 series AFI, there are options on what and how to deal with the influx of non-useable electronic devices. To that end, the three options that are currently in play are; 1. Return useable devices to Apple for cash/credit, 2. Use a no-cost electronics disposal recycler, or 3. Donate out of Air Force spec devices that have been wiped and reformatted to factory retail specs.

Being an office with a zero dollar operating budget, option number one makes the most sense and provides a cost savings to the United States Air Force. In short, Apple currently has a program where used, out of date/damaged mobile devices (iPads) can be returned. The down side of this option is that payout is only 10-20% of original cost. Additionally, the longer we hold the devices the further out of date they become, which in-turn continually decreases their return value. Ultimately we are looking at $25-$40 per device depending upon model/age/shape. Another item of note with this option is how to handle any funds that are reimbursed/recovered. Would the money go to the Wing? Split between the operational squadron Resource Advisor’s? Go to the Offutt OMD office?

Option two focuses primarily on environmental disposal considerations. While relatively safe to dispose of, out-of-date technical electronics are quickly becoming a major issue for environmental disposal consideration. According to a recent article in the UN’s Global E-waste Monitor 202 “In 2019, a record 53.6 million metric tons of electronic waste was generated worldwide” (Forte, Balde, Kuehr,& Bel, 2020). In an effort to be environmentally conscious, the Offutt OMD office has researched and located local options for disposal of out of date/damaged mobile devices (iPads) can be responsibly recycled at little to no cost. Utilization of this option allows us to get rid of the excess and out of date devices, but we gain no monetary benefit. The benefits of this option lies with the recycler taking profits from total weight of recyclable material we deliver.

The third option that was suggested was to reutilize and redistribute out-of-date iPads in the form of public outreach. This outreach would be accomplished by selecting low income elementary and middle schools in the Omaha/Bellevue/Papillion area donating our out-of-date mobile devices to the schools for issue to their students. The current pandemic has helped to amplify this need in the local community, and if the devices are outside of Air Force use requirements, in working repair, we have the option to make a great impact on the local community. This option would require the use of OMD staff personal contacts and coordination with selected school leadership individuals. If this option becomes a successful endeavor, the OMD office has developed a list of other organizations that are need based where our outdated materials can be reutilized by the local community with the understanding that we are gifting them the devices and not follow-on support.

Of the three options currently considered, the OMD office intends to pursue option 1 as its primary course of action. Any funds that can be recovered would ultimately be rolled back into funding for future technical refresh endeavors. However, option three is very tempting from a Public Affairs perspective. As such, the Director of Project BOCKSCAR is considering and ultimately will decide if the OMD office should do a split option 1/3 to maximize benefits and public awareness.

As we enter into the current technical refresh period, which will be the first for mobile devices under the project BOCKSCAR program, further developments in growth will require additional questions to be answered. Primarily, will Offutt become the ACC/Air Force iPad repository for end-of-life mobile devices? Will this natural progression cause the OMD office to support or develop an AFREP-like program that would strictly deal with electronic devices? Additional questions will continue pop-up and follow-on opportunities will present themselves to increase the overall footprint of project BOCKSCAR in not the 55th Wing, but also ACC and Air Force wide.
