What's In A Name?

A Cairn is a man-made pile of stones. The word cairn comes from the Scottish Gaelic: c√†rn. Cairns have been and are used for a broad variety of purposes, from prehistoric times to the present. In modern times, cairns are often erected as landmarks, a use they have had since ancient times.
